## üåü Key Highlights

### 1. **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) Architecture**

The project is built using the Feature-Sliced Design methodology, which promotes separation of concerns by dividing the application into logical slices:
- **App Layer:** Application-wide initialization and setup.
- **Entities Layer:** Domain entities (e.g., User, Product).
- **Features Layer:** Reusable features (e.g., authentication, filtering).
- **Pages Layer:** Complete pages for routing.
- **Processes Layer:** Global business processes (e.g., checkout flow).
- **Shared Layer:** Reusable code such as utilities, constants, or design tokens.

### 2. **Custom Design System**

- Found in the `ui/` directory.
- Can be extracted and published as a standalone npm library.
- Built with reusable components, typography, and theme support.
- Integrated with **Storybook** for showcasing all components in isolation.

### 3. **Mock Backend**

- `json-server` is used for simulating API responses during development.
- Configuration is located in `config/mock-server.json`.

### 4. **CI/CD Pipeline and Git Hooks**

- Pre-commit hooks ensure code quality with ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript checks.
- CI/CD pipeline configuration is managed via GitHub Actions.

### 5. **Internationalization (i18n)**

- Multi-language support is implemented using the `i18next` library.
- Language files are stored in `src/shared/translations/`.

### 6. **Storybook Integration**

- Storybook is configured to visualize components and features.
- Run `npm run storybook` to explore the design system and its components.

### 7. **Testing**

- Unit and integration tests are configured using Jest and React Testing Library.
- Test cases are located in `src/__tests__/`.

### 8. **Themes and adaptive design**

- 3 theme realization
- Adaptive design for dektop/mobile/tablet devices.


## üìã Configuration

This project is highly configurable:
- **Webpack Configs:** Located in `config/build` for different environments.
- **ESLint, Stylint and Prettier:** Config files are in the root directory for linting and formatting.
- **Storybook Configs:** Found in `config/storybook/`.
- **Testing Configs:** Jest and Testing Library setups in `config/jest`.

---

## üìà Future Improvements

- Enhance Storybook documentation for complex use cases.
- Add performance monitoring tools.
- Extend the design system with advanced components.
- Implement SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and compare performance benefits.

## Design Patterns and Architecture

This project implements several design patterns, core patterns to enhance code quality and maintainability:

- **Component-Based Architecture**: Encourages reusability and separation of concerns by dividing the UI into independent, reusable components.
- **Service Layer Pattern**: Abstracts API calls and business logic into services, promoting separation of concerns and easier testing.
- **Container-Presenter Pattern**: Separates the logic (containers) from the view (presentational components) to enhance reusability and maintainability.
- **Atomic Design** for UI components.
- **Redux Toolkit Slices** for state management.
- **Asynchronous Hooks** for handling requests and side effects.
- **Layered Decomposition:** dividing the application into modules (`entities`, `features`, `shared`, `widgets`, `pages`).

These patterns are instrumental in creating scalable and maintainable frontend applications.

## Pages and Features

The application includes the following pages and features:

- **Auth Page**: Provides functionality for authorization and registration.
- **Main Page**: Provides all Main Page information, links, functionality
- **Home Page**: Provides an overview and navigation links.
- **About Page**: Offers information about the project and its purpose.
- **Article Page**: Articles pages and comment form.
- **Feature Showcase**: Demonstrates the implementation of various design patterns and architectural principles.
- **Contact Page**: Includes a form for users to get in touch.
- **Profile Page**: Includes a profile information.
